            <h1>Digital Garden</h1>
            <p>This portfolio is part of <a href="/">my digital garden</a> - a simple website structured like a collection of interconnected notes, essays, cheatsheets, quotes - anything and everything that catches my interest and I think is worth sharing.</p>
<p>The key difference between a digital garden and a traditional blog is that a blog is usually niche - specific to a subject or theme or idea, whereas a digital garden isn't. And just like a real garden, it actually benefits from having a variety of things in it. It is a collection of different ideas and things worth sharing or saving.</p>
<p>The other way a digital garden differs from a traditional blog is that it is not intended to be a stream of content to be consumed in chronological order. Instead, the viewer is invited to free-fall through the content, wander, explore, and discover things for themselves. Some things will be polished and well-written. Some things will be rough and unmaintained. And that is the point - for it to be personal and organic.</p>
<p>The website was made with HTML, SCSS, JS. The posts are written in Markdown through Obsidian, converted to a static site via 11ty, deployed over Netlify.</p>
