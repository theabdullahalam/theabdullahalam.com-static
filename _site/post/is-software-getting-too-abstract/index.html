<p>Millenials and Baby Boomers saw the beginnings of the internet and the
digital era. The ones on the very edges of the Millenial and Gen-Z age
groups (zillenials?), grew up along with the technology. Gen-Z, is the
first generation that is digital-native; thrown right into a flourishing
digital age.</p>
<p>In almost every way, that is amazing. They get to participate in a
digital world after all suspicions have more or less settled, and
everyone has accepted the Internet as a part of life. Social media now
has a significant impact on the world, and unlike older generations
burdened with responsibilities, Gen-Z can participate in things and be
active online, while having much less to lose. They are uniquely
situated to drive change towards a better future on a (relatively)
egalitarian global platform.</p>
<h2>Abstraction</h2>
<p>In software (and even in hardware to some extent), how things work is
often much less important than that it works. This is helpful while
building software; rather than wracking your head over one big chunk of
code that does everything, you can build several smaller pieces of
'helper' code that have small and specific responsibilities. Such a
chunk of code will take some input, crunch some numbers, and give you
the correct output. Once you build this 'helper,' and test that it works
perfectly, you no longer need to worry about it again. You can re-use
this 'helper' in other programs. How this helper does what it does is
now irrelevant; all that matters is that it can do it reliably, so you
can re-use this code in other programs, or even share it with other
developers around the world.</p>
<p>Then you, or some other developer, can build other programs that make
use of this helper. Those programs are often 'helpers' themselves, that
take some input, and give relevant output, ready to be used by other
programs, adding yet another layer of abstraction to the unending
heirarchy.</p>
<p>This abstraction is a fundamental concept in computer science, and is
what allows people to build incredible things without having to
re-invent the wheel every single time.</p>
<h2>From a development pattern to UI pattern...</h2>
<p>UI design philosophies tend to go in two opposite directions. The first,
tries to be user-friendly; making the interface as idiot-proof as
possible, without revealing anything technical to the user. A friendly
facade, hiding away all the ugly nuts and bolts. The other kind, is one
that tries, instead, to be user-centric. These are more practical
interfaces that do allow the users to &quot;tinker with the machinery&quot;
underneath, allowing the occasional glimpse of how things might be
working under the hood, and making the presence of a UI a mere
convenience - nothing more.</p>
<p>The former tends to have mass-appeal. The latter generally appeals only
to hobbyist crowds.</p>
<h2>Growing up with the Internet</h2>
<p>People born in the 80s and 90s came of age along with the Internet. They
saw the ugly nuts and bolts, and are still getting used to seeing the
pretty, colorful and modernised packaging over it. The generation that
preceded, grew up into the finished products of the Industrial age, and
the generation that followed, is growing up into the finished products
of the Internet age.</p>
<p>Children talk to Google Assistant as if it is the source of answers. I
have had to explain to more than one kid, that Google doesn't have any
answers, that Google is just pretty good at finding other websites that
do have the answers. There is no bitterness here; only curiosity.
Afterall, we all learn from somewhere. It is, however, remarkable, the
conclusion a young mind communicating with a virtual assitant derives
from the experience, and it's effect on the world-model in their head. I
am genuinely curious to see how much the mental models, of technology in
general and software in particular, are different from reality, in the
minds of people who grow up in a world with abstracted technology being
ubiquitous.</p>
<p>Software products have matured to the point where the required human
interaction is highly idiot-proof. The psychology of design in general
and digital interface design in particular, have now had enough time to
evolve from having to mimic &quot;real world&quot; surfaces like wood and metal
(remember early iOS skeumorphic designs?) to having their own well
thought-out paradigms (Apple's Human Interface Design and Google's
Material Design, for eg.) that can be intuitively understood through a
kind of &quot;digital
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intertextuality">intertextuality</a> &quot;
alone.</p>
<p>All of this puts forth the question of whether or not it is important to
consider how much the products we use allow us to understand how they
work, or whether it is sufficient to be content with just the fact that
they do work, delegating the knowledge of the &quot;how&quot; to the group of
people who built it.</p>
<p>My personal opinion leans towards the former. With how easily available
knowledge is online, I would imagine that successive generations will be
open to learning new things, and retain the malleability of their minds
much more than any other generation in history. It is imperative,
therefore, to understand, at least to a certain extent, how things work.
Of course, it is impractical (and un-profitable) for companies to design
user-centric products, for they lack the mass-appeal user-friendly
products do, and there's nothing particularly wrong about that. It
follows, then, that we must take some time to at least develop a basic
understanding of how the technology we use everyday works, at least at a
very general level. This is increasingly important for newer generations
that did not have the privilege of watching the technology evolve from
the early stages, of glimpsing the nuts and bolts under the hood, before
so much of it got commoditised.</p>
