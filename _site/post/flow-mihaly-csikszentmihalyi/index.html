<p>This is one of the most important books I have ever read.</p>
<p>There are some books that use beautiful language and sharp opinions to
pull the rug from under your feet, questioning everything you've ever
known. You feel like, in that moment, your life has changed. Thereafter,
once the vertigo subsides, the only thing about your life that seems to
have changed is the fact that you have read a book that made you feel
that way, and nothing else. You're slightly more well-read, and that's
it.</p>
<p>This is not that kind of book. In fact, the immediate feeling is quite
the opposite. <strong>Flow</strong> is written in very straightforward language, and
proceeds to unpack with audacity a feeling nearly everyone of us has
felt at some point in our lives, lay it bare, and give us the vocabulary
and the intuition to revisit that feeling again. You think, &quot;huh, that's
cool&quot;, and move on.</p>
<p>And then, at random points during the following days, in the middle of
some activity, you realise how much of what the book said made sense.
You are able to recapture that elusive feeling of being fully present
and being in the moment. You realise that this book, which seemed
unassuming at first, is slowly changing your life in short but lasting
and positive ways.</p>
<p>&quot;Flow&quot; is the culmination of <strong>Mihály Csíkszentmihályi's</strong> years of
research on the state of mind where one feels pure joy - when you feel
like you are &quot;in the zone&quot;, ecstatic, forget all your worries, and
briefly even forget about yourself. Everyone has experienced this at
some point in their life, when they're so engrossed in something, or are
enjoying an activity or a moment so much, that they lose their grasp on
the passage of time, forget all their worries and anxieties, and are
wholly, effortlessly, present.</p>
<p>This book first unpacks and attempts to put to words that elusive, hard
to describe state of mind. Then, it lays down the conditions in which
one experiences that state of flow. Finally, it looks at examples of
easily accessible things most people can do to deliberately experience
flow. And that's it. That's the book. The simplicity works really,
really well.</p>
<p>The author is an accomplished psychologist, and the book is based on
substantial research - and it shows. Teetering right on the edge of
self-help, I was constantly worried it would derail into wishy-washy
opinionated advice about life, but thankfully it never did. It stuck to
psychology, facts and research. Which is a big win in my book.</p>
<p>Now, Flow is not without it's faults. Although it never fully derailed,
it did, at times, seem to have the structure of a self-help book. My
biggest gripe with that genre is fluff - taking 300 pages to say
something that could've been said in 30. While Flow is extremely dense
and full of knowledge in some parts, it does sometimes go on and on with
the anecdotes. Sometimes, it will share some information, and then
follow it up with a bunch of anecdotes from research subjects that
validates that information. I often found myself skimming over these
since the book was essentially saying the same thing again and again for
2-3 pages.</p>
<p>That being said, this book, on the whole, is fantastic. It's been a
while since I read it, and I still think about the ideas and concepts it
spoke about. I am glad I read it, and it has genuinely changed the way
the look at things in life that I enjoy.</p>
<h2>Favourite Quotes</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>A joyful life is an individual creation that cannot be copied from a
recipe.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Flow is being completely involved in an activity for its own sake. The
ego falls away. Time flies. Every action, movement, and thought
follows inevitably from the previous one, like playing jazz.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Of all the virtues we can learn no trait is more useful, more
essential for survival, and more likely to improve the quality of life
than the ability to transform adversity into an enjoyable challenge.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Most enjoyable activities are not natural; they demand an effort that
initially one is reluctant to make. But once the interaction starts to
provide feedback to the person's skills, it usually begins to be
intrinsically rewarding.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There are two words whose meanings reflect our somewhat warped
attitudes toward levels of commitment to physical or mental
activities. These are the terms &quot;amateur&quot; and &quot;dilettante&quot;. Nowadays
these labels are slightly derogatory. An amateur or a dilettante is
someone not quite up to par, a person not to be taken very seriously,
one whose performance falls short of professional standards. But
originally, &quot;amateur&quot;, from the Latin verb amare, &quot;to love&quot;, referred
to a person who loved what he was doing. Similarly a &quot;dilettante&quot;,
from the Latin delectare, &quot;to find delight in&quot;, was someone who
enjoyed a given activity.</p>
<p>The earliest meanings of these words therefore drew attention to
experiences rather than accomplishments; they described the subjective
rewards individuals gained from doing things, instead of focusing on
how well they were achieving. Nothing illustrates as clearly our
changing attitudes toward the value of experience as the fate of these
two words. There was a time when it was admirable to be an amateur
poet or a dilettante scientist, because it meant that the quality of
life could be improved by engaging in such activities. But
increasingly the emphasis has been to value behavior over subjective
states; what is admired is success, achievement, the quality of
performance rather than the quality of experience. Consequently it has
become embarrassing to be called a dilettante, even though to be a
dilettante is to achieve what counts most - the enjoyment one's
actions provide.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For those who live in large cities, flat sidewalks and right-angle
layouts make the physical act of walking easy. Walking on a mountain
trail is another thing altogether: for a skilled hiker each step
presents a different challenge to be resolved with a choice of the
most efficient foothold that will give the best leverage,
simultaneously taking into account the momentum and the center of
gravity of the body and the various surfaces - dirt, rocks, roots,
grass, branches - on which the foot can land.</p>
<p>On a difficult trail an experienced hiker walks with economy of motion
and lightness, and the constant adjustment of her steps to the terrain
reveals a highly sophisticated process of selecting the best solution
to a changing series of complex equations involving mass, velocity,
and friction. Of course these calculations are usually automatic, and
give the impression of being entirely intuitive, almost instinctive;
but if the walker does not process the right information about the
terrain, and fails to make the appropriate adjustments in her gait,
she will stumble or will soon grow tired. So while this kind of
walking might be entirely unselfconscious, it is in fact a highly
intense activity that requires concentrated attention.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>...success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue... as the
unintended side-effect of one's personal dedication to a course
greater than oneself.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Even what people take to be their most personal desires are usually
programmed by the imagined order. Let's consider, for example, the
popular desire to take a holiday abroad. There is nothing natural or
obvious about this. A chimpanzee alpha male would never think of using
his power in order to go on holiday into the territory of a
neighbouring chimpanzee band. The elite of ancient Egypt spent their
fortunes building Pyramids and having their corpses mummihed, but none
of them thought of going shop ping in Babylon or taking a skiing
holiday in Phoenicia. People today spend a great deal of money on
holidays abroad because they are true believers in the myths of
romantic consumerism.</p>
<p>Romanticism tells us that in order to make the most of our human
potential we must have as many different experiences as we can. We
must open ourselves to a wide spectrum of emotions; we must sample
various kinds of relationships; we must try different cuisines, we
must learn to appreciate different styles of music. One of the best
ways to do all that is to break free from our daily routine leave
behind our familiar setting, and go travelling in distant lands where
we can 'experience the culture, the smells, the tastes and the norms
of other people. We hear again and again the romantic myths about how
a new experience opened my eyes and changed my life.</p>
