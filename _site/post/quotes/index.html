<blockquote>
<p>Within the 'symphony of voices,' Kepler believed that the speed of
each planet corresponds to certain notes in the Latinate musical scale
popular in his day - do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, ti, do. He claimed that
in the harmony of the spheres, the tones of Earth are fa and mi, that
the Earth is forever humming fa and mi, and that they stand in a
straightforward way for the Latin word for famine.</p>
<p>&quot;With this symphony of voices man can play through the eternity of
time in less than an hour, and can taste in small measure the delight
of God, the Supreme Artist... I yield freely to the sacred frenzy...
the die is cast, and I am writing the book to be read either now or by
posterity, it matters not. It can wait a century for a reader, as God
Himself has waited 6,000 years for a witness.&quot; - Johannes Kepler, Collected Works</p>
<p><em>- Cosmos, Carl Sagan</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A book is made from a tree. It is an assemblage of flat, flexible
parts (still called 'leaves') imprinted with dark pigmented squiggles.
One glance at it and you hear the voice of another person - perhaps
someone dead for thousands of years. Across the millennia, the author
is speaking, clearly and silently, inside your head, directly to you.
Writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions, binding together
people, citizens of distant epochs, who never knew one another.</p>
<p>Books break the shackles of time, proof that humans can work magic.</p>
<p><em>- Cosmos, Carl Sagan</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The nitrogen in our DNA, the calcium in our teeth, the iron in our
blood, the carbon in our apple pies were made in the interiors of
collapsing stars. We are made of starstuff.</p>
<p><em>- Cosmos, Carl Sagan</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>National boundaries are not evident when we view the Earth from space.
Fanatical ethnic or religious or national chauvinisms are a little
difficult to maintain when we see our planet as a fragile blue
crescent fading to become an inconspicuous point of light against the
bastion and citadel of the stars.</p>
<p><em>- Cosmos, Carl Sagan</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>'I am, alas, a man of leisure,' he said softly. I have made the
economies in my time and I have now the means to enjoy the life of
idleness.'</p>
<p>'No, no, you would be unwise to do so. I can assure you, it is not so
gay as it sounds.' He sighed. 'How true is the saying that man was
forced to invent work in order to escape the strain of having to
think.'</p>
<p><em>- Agatha Christie, Death on the Nile</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>He was a lonely ghost uttering a truth that nobody would ever hear.
But so long as he uttered it, in some obscure way the continuity was
not broken. It was not by making yourself heard but by staying sane
that you carried on the human heritage.</p>
<p><em>- 1984, George Orwell</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The aim of the High is to remain where they are. The aim of the Middle
is to change places with the High. The aim of the Low, when they have
an aim - for it is an abiding characteristic of the Low that they are
too much crushed by drudgery to be more than intermittently conscious
of anything outside their daily lives - is to abolish all distinctions
and create a society in which all men shall be equal. Thus, throughout
history, a struggle which is the same in its main outlines recurs over
and over again.</p>
<p><em>- 1984, George Orwell</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Observe the rays of the sun in the composition of the rainbow, the
colours of which are generated by the falling rain, when each drop in
its descent takes every colour of the bow.</p>
<p><em>- A Treatise on Painting - Leonardo da Vinci</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A physical shortcoming could produce a kind of mental excess. The
process, it seemed, was reversible. Mental excess could produce, for
its own purposes, the voluntary blindness and deafness of deliberate
solitude, the artificial impotence of asceticism.</p>
<p><em>-Brave New World, Aldous Huxley</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For of course, some sort of general idea they must have, if they were
to do their work intelligently - though as little of one, if they were
to be good and happy members of society, as possible.</p>
<p><em>-Brave New World, Aldous Huxley</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Actual happiness looks pretty squalid in comparison with the
over-compensations for misery. And, of course, stability isn't nearly
so spectacular as instability. And being contented has none of the
glamour of a good fight against misfortune, none of of the
picturesqueness of a struggle with temptation, or a fatal overthrow by
passion or doubt. Happiness is never grand.</p>
<p><em>-Brave New World, Aldous Huxley</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The current ruling ontology denies any possibility of a social
causation of mental illness. The chemico-biologization of mental
illness is of course strictly commensurate with its de-politicization.
Considering mental illness an individual chemico-biological problem
has enormous benefits for capitalism. First, it reinforces Capital's
drive towards atomistic individualization (you are sick because of
your brain chemistry). Second, it provides an enormously lucrative
market in which multinational pharmaceutical companies can peddle
their pharmaceuticals (we can cure you with our SSRIs). It goes
without saying that all mental illnesses are neurologically
instantiated, but this says nothing about their causation. If it is
true, for instance, that depression is constituted by low serotonin
levels, what still needs to be explained is why particular individuals
have low levels of serotonin. This requires a social and political
explanation; and the task of repoliticizing mental illness is an
urgent one if the left wants to challenge capitalist realism.</p>
<p><em>- Mark Fisher, Capitalist Realism</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some of Nietzsche's most prescient pages are those in which he
describes the 'oversaturation of an age with history'. 'It leads an
age into a dangerous mood of irony in regard to itself', he wrote in
Untimely Meditations, and subsequently into the even more dangerous
mood of cynicism', in which 'cosmopolitan fingering', a detached
spectatorialism, replaces engagement and involvement. This is the
condition of Nietzsche's Last Man, who has seen everything, but is
decadently enfeebled precisely by this excess of (self) awareness.</p>
<p><em>- Mark Fisher, Capitalist Realism</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Every lie we tell incurs a debt to the truth. And sooner or later,
that debt is paid.</p>
<p><em>- Chernobyl, 2019</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Elizabeth also wept and was unhappy, but hers also was the misery of
innocence, which, like a cloud that passes over the fair moon, for a
while hides but cannot tarnish its brightness.</p>
<p><em>- Mary Shelly, Frankenstein</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Nothing is more painful to the human mind than, after the feelings
have been worked up by a quick succession of events, the dead calmness
of inaction and certainty which follows and deprives the soul both of
hope and fear.</p>
<p><em>- Mary Shelly, Frankenstein</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We have come to identify ourselves with the goal, we have become
committed to pursue it at all costs rather than admit defeat.</p>
<p>Determined to retain a positive outlook, we remove naysayers from our
lives, as the self-help industry instructs us. This may make for a
proud slogan for social-media profiles -- a snappy, self-assured
'Ignore the h8ers' -- but it can be a dangerous folly. By removing or
ignoring the sources of honest feedback, we create a neat means of
fuelling the downward spiral of self-deception.</p>
<p>When we proudly denounce those who would undermine our self-belief, we
emulate a model of strength we have been sold principally through the
biographies of successful, strong entrepreneurs. We equate persistent
commitment and the ability to laugh at one's detractors with a recipe
for success. But this is a lie. We believe it because we are told it
through many channels, but its source springs from a powerful select
few who boast about their life stories as they perceive them.</p>
<p><em>- Derren Brown, Happy: Why More or Less Everything is Absolutely Fine</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It is hard to think about your past without tidying it up into a kind
of story: one in which you are cast as the hero or victim.</p>
<p>Invariably we ignore the regular dice-rolls of chance or random luck;
successful high-flyers are typically prone to ignoring the interplay
of blind fortune when they credit their career trajectories to their
canny business sense or brute self-belief. We tell the story we want
to tell, and we live out those stories every day.</p>
<p><em>- Derren Brown, Happy: Why More or Less Everything is Absolutely Fine</em></p>
