<p>A collections of quotes, plucked from many different sources. Some of these match my own opinions. Some of these go completely against. Some of these aren't even opinions - just dialogues or passages or sentences that stuck out to me. In effect, this is a living scrapbook of amusing compositions of words.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Within the 'symphony of voices,' Kepler believed that the speed of
each planet corresponds to certain notes in the Latinate musical scale
popular in his day - do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, ti, do. He claimed that
in the harmony of the spheres, the tones of Earth are fa and mi, that
the Earth is forever humming fa and mi, and that they stand in a
straightforward way for the Latin word for famine.</p>
<p>&quot;With this symphony of voices man can play through the eternity of
time in less than an hour, and can taste in small measure the delight
of God, the Supreme Artist... I yield freely to the sacred frenzy...
the die is cast, and I am writing the book to be read either now or by
posterity, it matters not. It can wait a century for a reader, as God
Himself has waited 6,000 years for a witness.&quot; - Johannes Kepler, Collected Works</p>
<p><em>- Cosmos, Carl Sagan</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A book is made from a tree. It is an assemblage of flat, flexible
parts (still called 'leaves') imprinted with dark pigmented squiggles.
One glance at it and you hear the voice of another person - perhaps
someone dead for thousands of years. Across the millennia, the author
is speaking, clearly and silently, inside your head, directly to you.
Writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions, binding together
people, citizens of distant epochs, who never knew one another.</p>
<p>Books break the shackles of time, proof that humans can work magic.</p>

<p>The nitrogen in our DNA, the calcium in our teeth, the iron in our

collapsing stars. We are made of starstuff.</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>National boundaries are not evident when we view the Earth from space.
Fanatical ethnic or religious or national chauvinisms are a little
difficult to maintain when we see our planet as a fragile blue
crescent fading to become an inconspicuous point of light against the
bastion and citadel of the stars.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>'I am, alas, a man of leisure,' he said softly. I have made the
economies in my time and I have now the means to enjoy the life of
idleness.'</p>
<p>'No, no, you would be unwise to do so. I can assure you, it is not so
gay as it sounds.' He sighed. 'How true is the saying that man was
forced to invent work in order to escape the strain of having to
think.'</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He was a lonely ghost uttering a truth that nobody would ever hear.
But so long as he uttered it, in some obscure way the continuity was
not broken. It was not by making yourself heard but by staying sane
that you carried on the human heritage.</p>
<p><em>- 1984, George Orwell</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The aim of the High is to remain where they are. The aim of the Middle
is to change places with the High. The aim of the Low, when they have
an aim - for it is an abiding characteristic of the Low that they are
too much crushed by drudgery to be more than intermittently conscious
of anything outside their daily lives - is to abolish all distinctions
and create a society in which all men shall be equal. Thus, throughout
history, a struggle which is the same in its main outlines recurs over
and over again.</p>
<p><em>- 1984, George Orwell</em></p>

<p>Observe the rays of the sun in the composition of the rainbow, the
colours of which are generated by the falling rain, when each drop in
its descent takes every colour of the bow.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A physical shortcoming could produce a kind of mental excess. The
process, it seemed, was reversible. Mental excess could produce, for
its own purposes, the voluntary blindness and deafness of deliberate
solitude, the artificial impotence of asceticism.</p>
<p><em>-Brave New World, Aldous Huxley</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>For of course, some sort of general idea they must have, if they were
to do their work intelligently - though as little of one, if they were
to be good and happy members of society, as possible.</p>
<p><em>-Brave New World, Aldous Huxley</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Actual happiness looks pretty squalid in comparison with the
over-compensations for misery. And, of course, stability isn't nearly
so spectacular as instability. And being contented has none of the
glamour of a good fight against misfortune, none of of the
picturesqueness of a struggle with temptation, or a fatal overthrow by
passion or doubt. Happiness is never grand.</p>
<p><em>-Brave New World, Aldous Huxley</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The current ruling ontology denies any possibility of a social
causation of mental illness. The chemico-biologization of mental
illness is of course strictly commensurate with its de-politicization.
Considering mental illness an individual chemico-biological problem
has enormous benefits for capitalism. First, it reinforces Capital's
drive towards atomistic individualization (you are sick because of
your brain chemistry). Second, it provides an enormously lucrative
market in which multinational pharmaceutical companies can peddle
their pharmaceuticals (we can cure you with our SSRIs). It goes
without saying that all mental illnesses are neurologically
instantiated, but this says nothing about their causation. If it is
true, for instance, that depression is constituted by low serotonin
levels, what still needs to be explained is why particular individuals
have low levels of serotonin. This requires a social and political
explanation; and the task of repoliticizing mental illness is an
urgent one if the left wants to challenge capitalist realism.</p>
<p><em>- Mark Fisher, Capitalist Realism</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Some of Nietzsche's most prescient pages are those in which he
describes the 'oversaturation of an age with history'. 'It leads an
age into a dangerous mood of irony in regard to itself', he wrote in
Untimely Meditations, and subsequently into the even more dangerous
mood of cynicism', in which 'cosmopolitan fingering', a detached
spectatorialism, replaces engagement and involvement. This is the
condition of Nietzsche's Last Man, who has seen everything, but is
decadently enfeebled precisely by this excess of (self) awareness.</p>
<p><em>- Mark Fisher, Capitalist Realism</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Every lie we tell incurs a debt to the truth. And sooner or later,
that debt is paid.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Elizabeth also wept and was unhappy, but hers also was the misery of
innocence, which, like a cloud that passes over the fair moon, for a
while hides but cannot tarnish its brightness.</p>
<p><em>- Mary Shelly, Frankenstein</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Nothing is more painful to the human mind than, after the feelings
have been worked up by a quick succession of events, the dead calmness
of inaction and certainty which follows and deprives the soul both of
hope and fear.</p>
<p><em>- Mary Shelly, Frankenstein</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We have come to identify ourselves with the goal, we have become
committed to pursue it at all costs rather than admit defeat.</p>
<p>Determined to retain a positive outlook, we remove naysayers from our
lives, as the self-help industry instructs us. This may make for a
proud slogan for social-media profiles -- a snappy, self-assured
'Ignore the h8ers' -- but it can be a dangerous folly. By removing or
ignoring the sources of honest feedback, we create a neat means of
fuelling the downward spiral of self-deception.</p>
<p>When we proudly denounce those who would undermine our self-belief, we
emulate a model of strength we have been sold principally through the
biographies of successful, strong entrepreneurs. We equate persistent
commitment and the ability to laugh at one's detractors with a recipe
for success. But this is a lie. We believe it because we are told it
through many channels, but its source springs from a powerful select
few who boast about their life stories as they perceive them.</p>
<p><em>- Derren Brown, Happy: Why More or Less Everything is Absolutely Fine</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It is hard to think about your past without tidying it up into a kind
of story: one in which you are cast as the hero or victim.</p>
<p>Invariably we ignore the regular dice-rolls of chance or random luck;
successful high-flyers are typically prone to ignoring the interplay
of blind fortune when they credit their career trajectories to their
canny business sense or brute self-belief. We tell the story we want
to tell, and we live out those stories every day.</p>
<p><em>- Derren Brown, Happy: Why More or Less Everything is Absolutely Fine</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It's easy to become as obsessed with online metrics as money. It can
then be tempting to use those metrics to decide what to work on next,
without taking into account how shallow those metrics really are. An
Amazon rank doesn't tell you whether someone read your book twice and
loved it so much she passed it on to a friend. Instagram likes don't
tell you whether an image you made stuck with someone for a month. A
stream count doesn't equal an actual human being showing up to your
live show and dancing.</p>
<p><em>- Austin Kleon, Keep Going</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Lots of people want to be the noun without doing the verb. They want
the job title without the work.</p>
<p>If you pick the wrong noun to aspire to, you'll be stuck with the
wrong verb, too. When people use the word &quot;creative&quot; as a job title,
it not only falsely divides the world into &quot;creatives&quot; and
&quot;non-creatives,&quot; but also implies that the work of a &quot;creative&quot; is
&quot;being creative.&quot;</p>
<p>But being creative is never an end; it is a means to something else.
Creativity is just a tool.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dusk, like a palpable entity, entered the room, and the dancing circle
of yellow light about the torches etched itself into the ever sharper
distinction against the gathering greyness beyond.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He had long ago decided that no worthwhile woman could ever be
seduced; you could present the possibility to them, but you had to
leave it to them to do the seducing for you, and if they weren't so
minded, there was very little you could do to change their outlook.</p>
<p><em>- Isaac Asimov, Nightfall</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Why had it happened? she asked herself. Why? Why? Why? Were we so
evil? Had we strayed so far from the path of the gods that we needed
to be punished this way?</p>
<p>No. No! There are no gods; there was no punishment. Of that much,
Siferra was still certain. She had no doubt that this was simply the
working of blind fate, brought about by the impersonal movements of
inaminate and uncaring worlds and suns, drawing together every two
thousand years in dispassionate coincidence.</p>
<p>That was all. An accident.</p>
<p><em>- Isaac Asimov, Nightfall</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We think we know what we're doing. We have always thought so. We never
seem to acknowledge that we have been wrong in the past, and so might
be wrong in the future. Instead, each generation writes off earlier
errors as the result of bad thinking by less able minds - and then
confidently embarks on fresh errors of its own.</p>

<p>He had no right to all the grace and bounty of this world, earned and

<p>He went on writing letters to Urras, even when he mailed none of them

<p>&quot;If you can see a thing whole,&quot; he said, &quot;it seems that it's always
beautiful. Planets, lives.... But close up, a world's all dirt and
rocks. And day to day, life's a hard job, you get tired, you lose the
pattern. You need distance, interval. The way to see how beautiful the
earth is, is to see it as the moon. The way to see how beautiful life
is, is from the vantage point of death.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;There's a point, around age twenty,&quot; Bedap said. &quot;when you have to

make a virtue of your peculiarities.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When they sang, both the exhilaration and the fear became a blind
exaltation; his eyes filled with tears. It was deep, in the deep
streets, softened by open air and by distances, indistinct,
overwhelming, that lifting up of thousands of voices in one song. The
singing of the front of the march, far away up the street, and of the
endless crowds coming on behind, was put out of phase by the distance
the sound must travel, so that the melody seemed always to be lagging
and catching up with itself, like a canon, and all the parts of the
song where being sung at one time, in the same moment, though each
singer sang the tune as a line from beginning to end.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;But I'm luckier. A scientist can pretend that his work isn't himself,
it's merely the impersonal truth. An artist can't hide behind the
truth. He can't hide anywhere.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you evade suffering you also evade the chance of joy. Pleasure you
may get, or pleasures, but you will not be fulfilled. You will not

<p>&quot;Where does your soul go, when you die in Hell?&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;And you will come back,&quot; Takver said. Her eyes were very dark, a soft
darkness, like the darkness of a forest at night.</p>
<p><em>- Ursula Le Guin, The Dispossesed</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>A night-blooming flower from some unimaginable world had opened among
the dark leaves and was sending out its perfume with patient,
unavailing sweetness to attract some unimaginable moth trillions of
miles away, in a garden on a world circling another star. The
sunlights differ, but there is only one darkness.</p>
<p><em>- Ursula Le Guin, The Dispossesed</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>..the fossil record of a few million years ago is replete with a great
variety of manlike forms, an interesting number of which are found
with holes or fractures in their skulls. Some of these injuries may
have been inflicted by leopards or hyenas; but Leakey and the South
African anatomist Raymond Dart believed that many of them were
inflicted by our ancestors. In Pliocene/Pleistocene times there was
almost certainly a vigorous competition among many manlike forms, of
which only one line survived-the tool experts, the line that led to
us. What role killing played in that competition remains an open
question. The gracile Australopithecines were erect, agile, fleet and
three and a half feet tall: &quot;little people.&quot; I sometimes wonder
whether our myths about gnomes, trolls, giants and dwarfs could
possibly be a genetic or cultural memory of those times.</p>
<p><em>- Carl Sagan, The Dragons of Eden</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Even at the time that the Eden story was written, the development of
cognitive skills was seen as endowing man with godlike powers and
awesome responsibilities. God says: &quot;Behold, the man is become as one
of us, to know good and evil, and now, lest he put forth his hand, and
take also of the Tree of Life, and eat, and live forever&quot; (Genesis
3:22), he must be driven out of the Garden. God places cherubim with a
flaming sword east of Eden to guard the Tree of Life from the
ambitions of man.</p>
<p>Perhaps the Garden of Eden is not so different from Earth as it
appeared to our ancestors of some three or four million years ago,
during a legendary golden age when the genus Homo was perfectly
interwoven with the other beasts and vegetables. After the exile from
Eden we find, in the biblical account, mankind condemned to death;
hard work; clothing and modesty as preventatives of sexual
stimulation; the dominance of men over women; the domestication of
plants (Cain); the domestication of animals (Abel); and murder (Cain
plus Abel). These all correspond reasonably well to the historical and
archaeological evidence. In the Eden metaphor, there is no evidence of
murder before the Fall. But those fractured skulls of bipeds not on
the evolutionary line to man may be evidence that our ancestors
killed, even in Eden, many manlike animals.</p>
<p>Civilization develops not from Abel, but from Cain the murderer. The
very word &quot;civilization&quot; derives from the Latin word for city. It is
the leisure time, community organization and specialization of labor
in the first cities that permitted the emergence of the arts and
technologies we think of as the hallmarks of civilizations. The first
city, according to Genesis, was constructed by Cain, the inventor of
agriculture - a technology that requires a fixed abode. And it is his
descendants, the sons of Lamech, who invent both &quot;artifices in brass
and iron&quot; and musical instruments. Metallurgy and music-technology and
art - are in the line from Cain. And the passions that lead to murder
do not abate: Lamech says, &quot;For I have slain a man for wounding me,
and a young man for bruising me; if Cain shall be avenged sevenfold,
truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.&quot; The connection between murder and
invention has been with us ever since. Both derive from agriculture
and civilization.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thus the frontal lobes may be involved with peculiarly human functions
in two different ways. If they control anticipation of the future,
they must also be the sites of concern, the locales of worry. This is
why transection of the frontal lobes reduces anxiety. But prefrontal
lobotomy must also greatly reduce the patient's capacity to be human.</p>
<p>The price we pay for anticipation of the future is anxiety about it.</p>

<p>Current-borne, wave-flung, tugged hugely by the whole might of ocean,
the jellyfish drifts in the tidal abyss. The light shines through it,
and the dark enters it. Borne, flung, tugged from anywhere to
anywhere, for in the deep sea there is no compass but nearer and
farther, higher and lower, the jellyfish hangs and sways; pulses move
slight and quick within it, as the vast diurnal pulses beat in the
moondriven sea. Hanging, swaying, pulsing, the most vulnerable and
insubstantial creature, it has for its defense the violence and power
of the whole ocean, to which it has entrusted its being, its going,
and its will.*</p>
<p>But here rise the stubborn continents. The shelves of gravel and the
cliffs of rock break from water baldly into air, that dry, terrible

all that, of giving it a name and ceasing to love where the name
ceases to apply? What is love of one's country; is it hate of one's
uncountry? Then it's not a good thing. Is it simply self-love? That's
a good thing, but one mustn't make a virtue of it, or a profession.
Insofar as I love life, I love the hills of the Domain of Estre, but

<p>Tuppence was ushered into a room on the right of the long passage. A
woman was standing by the fire-place. She was no longer in her first
youth, and the beauty she undeniably possessed was hardened and
coarsened. In her youth, she must have been dazzling. Her pale gold
hair, owing a slight assistance to art, was coiled low on her neck,
her eyes, of a piercing electric blue, seemed to possess a faculty of
boring into the very soul of the person she was looking at.</p>
<p>And yet, despite her swaying grace, and the almost ethereal beauty of
her face, you felt instinctively the presence of something hard and
menacing, a kind of metallic strength that found expression in the

<p>Look inwards, for a moment, and consider the contents of your mind. In
the course of an ordinary day, you'll think a huge number of different
thoughts. You might believe it's Thursday morning, deny that it's too
late to catch the train, expect the coffee shop to be open, want the
queue to be shorter, wish the guy in front of you would hurry up, hope
it's not now too late to catch the train, suspect that the guy in
front of you is an idiot, wonder why you thought you had time for
coffee when clearly only a fool would risk missing the train and now
you'll never make it, what people are going to think about you showing
up late, and so on, for the many hurried moments of your conscious
life.</p>
<p>Maybe what makes you think about coffee in the first place is another
thing in your head, a feeling of tiredness that gets your attention
over and above the other bodily sensations you have, all the pains,
tickles, twinges and itches and what ever else you might feel.
Colouring all this are other things, not quite thoughts or bodily
feelings, but emotions like love, anger, regret and happiness. Of
course, there's also the passing show, the perceptual experiences you
have when your sense organs bump into the world - all the sights,
sounds, tastes, touches and smells that come together to immerse you
in a three-dimensional picture of everything around you. All the while
you remember some things, imagine others, daydream, wonder, plan, and
generally get on with your inner life. In doing all this you might
notice another something at the centre of it all: you, or at least the
sense that you're doing all the thinking and feeling and seeing and
everything else.</p>
<p>But what is all this mental reality? It's not just you, but a lot of
world - every person and every creature with a point of view. Is a
thought another thing like a book or a boat, or is it an entirely
different sort of something? How do thoughts fit in to the physical
world? Is it right to think of mental things as really real, or is it
all somehow reducible to the physical world of particles and forces?
Philosophers zero in on all this with two questions. What is a mind?
And what is the relationship between mind and body?</p>

<p>The greater part of human activity is designed to make permanent those
experiences and joys which are only lovable because they are changing.
Music is a delight because of its rhythm and flow. Yet the moment you
arrest the flow and prolong a note or chord beyond its time, the
rhythm is destroyed. Because life is likewise a flowing process,
change and death are its necessary parts. To work for their exclusion
is to work against life.</p>

<p>For the animal to be happy it is enough that this moment be enjoyable.
But man is hardly satisfied with this at all. He is much more
concerned to have enjoyable memories and expectations --- especially
the latter. With these assured, he can put up with an extremely
miserable present. Without this assurance, he can be extremely
miserable in the midst of immediate physical pleasure.</p>
<p><em>- Alan Watts, The Wisdom of Insecurity</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The power of memories and expectations is such that for most human
beings the past and the future are not as real, but more real than the
present. The present cannot be lived happily unless the past has been
&quot;cleared up&quot; and the future is bright with promise.</p>

<p>What we have forgotten is that thoughts and words are conventions, and
that it is fatal to take conventions too seriously. A convention is a
social convenience, as, for example, money. Money gets rid of the
inconveniences of barter. But it is absurd to take money too
seriously, to confuse it with real wealth, because it will do you no
good to eat it or wear it for clothing. Money is more or less static,
for gold, silver, strong paper, or a bank balance can &quot;stay put&quot; for a
long time. But real wealth, such as food, is perishable. Thus a
community may possess all the gold in the world, but if it does not
farm its crops it will starve.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is convention alone which persuades me that I am simply this body
bounded by a skin in space, and by birth and death in time.</p>
<p>Where do I begin and end in space? I have relations to the sun and air
which are just as vital parts of my existence as my heart. The
movement in which I am a pattern or convolution began incalculable
ages before the (conventionally isolated) event called birth, and will
continue long after the event called death. Only words and conventions
can isolate us from the entirely undefinable something which is
everything.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thus the &quot;brainy&quot; economy designed to produce this happiness is a
fantastic vicious circle which must either manufacture more and more
pleasures or collapse---providing a constant titillation of the ears,
eyes, and nerve ends with incessant streams of almost inescapable
noise and visual distractions. The perfect &quot;subject&quot; for the aims of
this economy is the person who continuously itches his ears with the
radio, preferably using the portable kind which can go with him at all
hours and in all places. His eyes flit without rest from television
screen, to newspaper, to magazine, keeping him in a sort of
orgasm-with-out-release through a series of teasing glimpses of shiny
automobiles, shiny female bodies, and other sensuous surfaces,
interspersed with such restorers of sensitivity---shock
treatments---as &quot;human interest&quot; shots of criminals, mangled bodies,
wrecked airplanes, prize fights, and burning buildings. The literature
or discourse that goes along with this is similarly manufactured to
tease without satisfaction, to replace every partial gratification
with a new desire.</p>

<p>How long have the planets been circling the sun? Are they getting
anywhere, and do they go faster and faster in order to arrive? How
often has the spring returned to the earth? Does it come faster and
fancier every year, to be sure to be better than last spring, and to
hurry on its way to the spring that shall out-spring all springs?</p>
<p>The meaning and purpose of dancing is the dance. Like music, also, it
is fulfilled in each moment of its course. You do not play a sonata in

<p>We are going to die, and that makes us the lucky ones. Most people are

Certainly those unborn ghosts include greater poets than Keats,
scientists greater than Newton. We know this because the set of

<p>If everything is judged by how 'useful' it is - useful for staying

<p>We have an appetite for wonder, a poetic appetite, which real science
ought to be feeding but which is being hijacked, often for monetary
gain, by purveyors of superstition, the paranormal and astrology.
Resonant phrases like 'the Fourth House of the Age of Aquarius', or
'Neptune went retrograde and moved into Sagittarius' whip up a bogus
romance which, to the naïve and impressionable, is almost
indistinguishable from authentic scientific poetry.</p>

<p>In another Japanese Buddhist fable, two traveling Zen monks were about
to wade across a river when a young woman asked them to carry her over
the swift water. Both of these monks had taken advanced vows and were
not permitted to touch women, but without hesitation the older monk
lifted her up, put her on his back, and walked across. When they
reached the other side, he let the woman down and, without any small
talk, walked away. A few hours later the younger monk blurted out,
&quot;Aren't we monks? Why did you carry that woman?&quot;</p>
<p>The older monk replied, &quot;I put her down a long time ago. Why are you
still carrying her?&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most images of the Buddha show him in the posture of sitting
meditation, in the particular attitude known as padmasana, the posture
of the lotus, with the legs crossed and the feet resting, soles
upward, upon the thighs.</p>
<p>Sitting meditation is not, as is often supposed, a spiritual
&quot;exercise,&quot; a practice followed for some ulterior object. From a
Buddhist standpoint, it is simply the proper way to sit, and it seems
perfectly natural to remain sitting so long as there is nothing else
to be done, and so long as one is not consumed with nervous agitation.
To the restless temperament of the West, sitting meditation may seem
to be an unpleasant discipline, because we do not seem to be able to
sit &quot;just to sit&quot; without qualms of conscience, without feeling that
we ought to be doing something more important to justify our
existence. To propitiate this restless conscience, sitting meditation
must therefore be regarded as an exercise, a discipline with an
ulterior motive. Yet at that very point it ceases to be meditation
(dhyana) in the Buddhist sense, for where there is purpose, where
there is seeking and grasping for results, there is no dhyana.</p>
