<p>how to fall in love with the inevitable rain<br>
if it is going to wash your favourite puddle away?</p>
<p>how to welcome that fall with a smile<br>
which will wither your favourite flowers?</p>
<p>how to look forward to surgery<br>
when the wound kind of feels nice?</p>
<p>how to look forward to death when you can't remember<br>
what not existing before birth felt like?</p>
<p>how to face the reality of heartbreak<br>
when you finally feel what vulnerability feels like?</p>
<p>sure, one may learn not to disturb the surface<br>
to let the moon reflect, but</p>
<p>how does one not want to collect water<br>
from the stream for himself,<br>
to actually see the moon in the first place?</p>
<p>how does one not fall in love with the shards,<br>
when broken glass is all they've seen glints of light in?</p>
<p>how does one dare breathe out,<br>
when holding a breath in<br>
is the only thing that<br>
overwhelms that knot in their gut?</p>
