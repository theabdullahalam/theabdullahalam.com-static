<p>Why is it that<br>
feelings only<br>
feel real<br>
when directed to someone?</p>
<p>Why does music<br>
make you yearn<br>
for having<br>
a lover to yearn?</p>
<p>Why can't love,<br>
like clouds,<br>
just exist?</p>
<p>Wish we could love<br>
and lust<br>
and ache<br>
and envy<br>
as aimlessly<br>
as an evening walk.</p>
<p>Wish we could go<br>
for a walk in the sky.</p>
