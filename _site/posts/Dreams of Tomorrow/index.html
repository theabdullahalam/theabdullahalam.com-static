<p>Chasing that<br>
will-o'-the-wisp<br>
of that which you've<br>
always dreamed of,<br>
it would be foolish<br>
to make that chase<br>
the only joy<br>
in your life.</p>
<p>Where will you go<br>
when your guiding star<br>
is directly overhead?</p>
<p>A broken promise<br>
shatters dreams.</p>
<p>A fulfilled promise<br>
simply hands them<br>
over to you<br>
and then promptly<br>
rests in peace.</p>
<p>So when your dream<br>
does finally arrive,<br>
what new promise<br>
will you make to yourself<br>
strong enough to bear<br>
the weight of today?</p>
