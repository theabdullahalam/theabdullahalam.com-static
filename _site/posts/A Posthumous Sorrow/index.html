<p>Losing a loved one is like<br>
Losing a part of yourself, they say.</p>
<p>It's like,<br>
The excruciating withdrawal from<br>
An addiction of decades,<br>
And five stages of grief,<br>
Fifteen times over,<br>
Simultaneously,<br>
They say.</p>
<p>But for you,<br>
Your very first trauma<br>
Left a void so dark<br>
With tendrils wrapped around<br>
Each of your ventricle of your heart,<br>
And it can no longer beat beyond<br>
Barely keeping you alive,<br>
With no energy left<br>
For ecstasy or grief<br>
And so now death...<br>
Is but a blip.</p>
<p>An immeasurable crest<br>
On an ECG,<br>
A detached observation;<br>
Dispassionate, but uncruel.</p>
<p>But the absence is incessant.<br>
The absence... will linger.<br>
Not stubbornly, but matter-of-factly.</p>
<p>And four months from now,<br>
When you've had too many smiles<br>
And too few catastrophes,<br>
that, is when the absence<br>
Will make you feel it's presence<br>
And you will break down then,<br>
At the wrong place<br>
At the wrong time<br>
In the wrong context<br>
And perhaps,<br>
You'll justify it<br>
Like I did<br>
In a poem written<br>
In third person<br>
Just as detached from reality<br>
As you are now.</p>
<p>You grief will begin,<br>
When everyone else's<br>
Has ended.</p>
<p>To you, my friend,<br>
Death will always be<br>
A posthumous sorrow.</p>
