better a work in progress\
than an unfixable mess?

or better a temporary mess\
than an unending work in progress?

works in progress\
live all the lives\
without\
getting stuck up\
on one of them...

a mess is a mess\
only because it was\
once lucky enough\
to be a completed work...

works in progress\
find comfort\
in being in progress...

unfixable messes\
find comfort\
in past laurels...

works in progress\
have no fixed state\
and are forever waiting\
for patterns in the chaos...

messes once did\
have a fixed state\
and are forever waiting\
to be whole again...

both,\
dependent on fate...

both,\
victims of fate...

both,\
fixated on\
the other side...
