Cursing the comforts, the safety of shades\
Envying the creatures fulfilling their roles\
I hide from this world, well camouflaged\
Among the wild weeds of wandering souls

I don't know how or why or when\
I was taught to look, but without desire.\
To not fan the flames, just look, unless,\
You're willing to light yourself on fire.

I gaze at the stars studded on the sky\
But they crash around me; in fear I freeze\
Then I wipe my eyes and, the heaven restores,\
As if falling tears carry the weight of galaxies.

Going round and round in circles,\
Resilience felt futile after all,\
When I learnt at last that orbits\
Are a never-ending freefall...
