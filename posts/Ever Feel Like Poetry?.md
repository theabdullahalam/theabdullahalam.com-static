Ever feel like poetry?

Not like reading poetry,\
not like writing poetry,\
but, just,\
being poetry?

To be able to conjure up\
images and\
places in minds, like\
merely writing the words\
"tropical islands", or\
"starry nights", or\
"dew-covered grass" can\
trigger thoughts and\
stimulate senses\
and create miniature worlds\
entirely out of nothing.

Ever feel like\
being like that?

To be able to\
conjure worlds from nothing?\
To be, and not just exist?\
To tease the slightest hints and\
set symphonies in motion?

To run non-stop\
with the\
pace, the\
confidence, the\
unstoppability and the\
euphoria of a\
sentence that\
dares to keep going\
on and on\
and on and\
on?

To love deeply\
with the exactness\
of the right words\
in the right places\
in the right order\
at the right moments\
and have precisely the\
effect you desire and\
relish the desires\
you wished for?

Can a person\
be a poem?

Can a person\
choose to not be\
a jumble of verses\
struggling\
even for lilt?

Should one, even?

For now,\
might as well\
pen the desires down\
and create\
a diorama of metaphors\
with the centerpiece being\
the poem you wish to be.
