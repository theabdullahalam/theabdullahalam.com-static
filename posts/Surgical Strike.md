Cheer, as\
the explosives rapidly combust, as\
the heats sears the skin, as\
the flames boil the flesh, as\
children watch their dads cheer,\
learning what to cheer about.

Let your blood curdle, as\
they retaliate, as\
they fight flames with flames, fight\
jeers with jets, light\
fires to camps, unite\
a democracy of millions\
over hatred.

Loathe those who\
rose\
to speak against, foes\
who you made over differences, reading\
news curated by a totalitarian, censored\
to show only that which supports an agenda,\
a hivemind guided, the fine print missed, or\
print misguided, it\
is impossible to tell.

How can we know the reality,\
the situation's true gravity,\
behind euphemisms, the actuality,\
the pain, the misunderstanding, the\
truth from falsehood, the\
validity of sources,\
the source's source of validity,\
tumbling down the rabbit hole,\
you smack the bottom, lo and behold,\
you're far far behind\
and those around you\
are ahead of you,\
they've found a fight,\
and a consistent enemy\
to keep their minds\
occupied\
and then you find,\
you shouldn't have tried,\
you shouldn't have sought\
the truth from lies,\
because sometimes,\
the search for truth,\
to you denies,\
the much needed\
peace of mind,\
and so you cry\
thinking the only\
way to find\
peace of mind,\
is to give in\
to the ambiguity of\
truth and lies,\
and stand alongside,\
the majority and fight,\
for nobility\
is all in the mind.

Give in.\
Give up.\
Believe.

In the fight between\
morality, dignity and noblity on one side,\
and satisfaction and happiness on the other,\
ignorance seems to always take the cake.
