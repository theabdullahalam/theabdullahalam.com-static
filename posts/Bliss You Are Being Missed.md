Bliss, you are being missed.

Your soft kisses like\
the notes of a wind chime\
tinkling in a faint breeze\
are being missed.

Your tinkling is inaudible\
in this raging sea\
of chaotic cacophony.

The other day I\
took my ear too close\
to try to listen\
but\
bumped into you instead\
and now you are either\
there too strong\
to be blissful\
or too weak to\
not drown in\
all the noise.

Bliss, you are being missed.

If I can't find you,\
I don't find you,\
and if I chase you,\
I ruin you.

Bliss, you are being missed.

I can't seem to\
not want you enough\
to actually not want you\
instead of just trying\
to fool the universe into\
thinking I don't want you\
so I actually find you.

Bliss, you are ethereal.\
Bliss, you are everywhere.\
Bliss, you are ephemeral.\
Bliss, you are evasive.

Bliss, you are being missed.
