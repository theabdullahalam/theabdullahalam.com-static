> Within the 'symphony of voices,' Kepler believed that the speed of
> each planet corresponds to certain notes in the Latinate musical scale
> popular in his day - do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, ti, do. He claimed that
> in the harmony of the spheres, the tones of Earth are fa and mi, that
> the Earth is forever humming fa and mi, and that they stand in a
> straightforward way for the Latin word for famine.
>
> "With this symphony of voices man can play through the eternity of
> time in less than an hour, and can taste in small measure the delight
> of God, the Supreme Artist... I yield freely to the sacred frenzy...
> the die is cast, and I am writing the book to be read either now or by
> posterity, it matters not. It can wait a century for a reader, as God
> Himself has waited 6,000 years for a witness." - Johannes Kepler, Collected Works
> 
> *- Cosmos, Carl Sagan*

> A book is made from a tree. It is an assemblage of flat, flexible
> parts (still called 'leaves') imprinted with dark pigmented squiggles.
> One glance at it and you hear the voice of another person - perhaps
> someone dead for thousands of years. Across the millennia, the author
> is speaking, clearly and silently, inside your head, directly to you.
> Writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions, binding together
> people, citizens of distant epochs, who never knew one another.
>
> Books break the shackles of time, proof that humans can work magic.
> 
> *- Cosmos, Carl Sagan*

> The nitrogen in our DNA, the calcium in our teeth, the iron in our
> blood, the carbon in our apple pies were made in the interiors of
> collapsing stars. We are made of starstuff.
> 
> *- Cosmos, Carl Sagan*

> National boundaries are not evident when we view the Earth from space.
> Fanatical ethnic or religious or national chauvinisms are a little
> difficult to maintain when we see our planet as a fragile blue
> crescent fading to become an inconspicuous point of light against the
> bastion and citadel of the stars.
> 
> *- Cosmos, Carl Sagan*

> 'I am, alas, a man of leisure,' he said softly. I have made the
> economies in my time and I have now the means to enjoy the life of
> idleness.'
>
> 'No, no, you would be unwise to do so. I can assure you, it is not so
> gay as it sounds.' He sighed. 'How true is the saying that man was
> forced to invent work in order to escape the strain of having to
> think.'
> 
> *- Agatha Christie, Death on the Nile*

> He was a lonely ghost uttering a truth that nobody would ever hear.
> But so long as he uttered it, in some obscure way the continuity was
> not broken. It was not by making yourself heard but by staying sane
> that you carried on the human heritage.
>  
> *- 1984, George Orwell*

> The aim of the High is to remain where they are. The aim of the Middle
> is to change places with the High. The aim of the Low, when they have
> an aim - for it is an abiding characteristic of the Low that they are
> too much crushed by drudgery to be more than intermittently conscious
> of anything outside their daily lives - is to abolish all distinctions
> and create a society in which all men shall be equal. Thus, throughout
> history, a struggle which is the same in its main outlines recurs over
> and over again.
>  
> *- 1984, George Orwell*

> Observe the rays of the sun in the composition of the rainbow, the
> colours of which are generated by the falling rain, when each drop in
> its descent takes every colour of the bow.
> 
> *- A Treatise on Painting - Leonardo da Vinci*

> A physical shortcoming could produce a kind of mental excess. The
> process, it seemed, was reversible. Mental excess could produce, for
> its own purposes, the voluntary blindness and deafness of deliberate
> solitude, the artificial impotence of asceticism.
> 
> *-Brave New World, Aldous Huxley*

> For of course, some sort of general idea they must have, if they were
> to do their work intelligently - though as little of one, if they were
> to be good and happy members of society, as possible.
> 
> *-Brave New World, Aldous Huxley*

> Actual happiness looks pretty squalid in comparison with the
> over-compensations for misery. And, of course, stability isn't nearly
> so spectacular as instability. And being contented has none of the
> glamour of a good fight against misfortune, none of of the
> picturesqueness of a struggle with temptation, or a fatal overthrow by
> passion or doubt. Happiness is never grand.
> 
> *-Brave New World, Aldous Huxley*

> The current ruling ontology denies any possibility of a social
> causation of mental illness. The chemico-biologization of mental
> illness is of course strictly commensurate with its de-politicization.
> Considering mental illness an individual chemico-biological problem
> has enormous benefits for capitalism. First, it reinforces Capital's
> drive towards atomistic individualization (you are sick because of
> your brain chemistry). Second, it provides an enormously lucrative
> market in which multinational pharmaceutical companies can peddle
> their pharmaceuticals (we can cure you with our SSRIs). It goes
> without saying that all mental illnesses are neurologically
> instantiated, but this says nothing about their causation. If it is
> true, for instance, that depression is constituted by low serotonin
> levels, what still needs to be explained is why particular individuals
> have low levels of serotonin. This requires a social and political
> explanation; and the task of repoliticizing mental illness is an
> urgent one if the left wants to challenge capitalist realism.
> 
> *- Mark Fisher, Capitalist Realism*

> Some of Nietzsche's most prescient pages are those in which he
> describes the 'oversaturation of an age with history'. 'It leads an
> age into a dangerous mood of irony in regard to itself', he wrote in
> Untimely Meditations, and subsequently into the even more dangerous
> mood of cynicism', in which 'cosmopolitan fingering', a detached
> spectatorialism, replaces engagement and involvement. This is the
> condition of Nietzsche's Last Man, who has seen everything, but is
> decadently enfeebled precisely by this excess of (self) awareness.
> 
> *- Mark Fisher, Capitalist Realism*

> Every lie we tell incurs a debt to the truth. And sooner or later,
> that debt is paid.
> 
> *- Chernobyl, 2019*
