And she slipped away\
and dripped away\
more and more and\
fingers that couldn't\
stop her, trembled\
"Who needs water anyway?"

The dried up throat\
saw right through the ruse.

The mini stream trickled\
and flowed down the dune,\
shrinking in the heat\
shriveling like the rose who\
was neglected because she\
grew too many thorns.

Her lovers never\
saw past her fear.

The last drop of her,\
remained in the sand,\
grew smaller\
and smaller,\
then vanished\
into thin air.

But the mirage\
of the drop\
still flickered\
in his heart\
and he dare not get\
too close lest\
it vanish too.
