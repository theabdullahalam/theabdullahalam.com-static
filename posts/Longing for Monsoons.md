When the sky\
weeps in catharsis,\
and tears trickle\
down the panes,\
and the soft patter\
of tiny raindrops\
fills the air\
pushing away\
stray wisps\
of anxiety and despair -\
that feeling\
is one love\
my heart could never\
manage to forget.

That clouds are drizzling\
over the city\
is a common nuisance\
in everyone's head\
and now finally,\
after many many months\
of everyone trapped\
in their own personal hells\
made out of pockets\
of isolated chaos\
in the chaos of the city,\
everyone's chaotic\
cacophonies sync up\
into a harmony of collective\
innocuous inconvenience,\
which,\
however gloomy.\
is, finally,\
melodious music.

The string of thoughts\
the gloom and the patter\
hold onto so\
effortlessly\
hangs lonely in the mind\
the rest of the year,\
yearning to be held\
by the comforting grip\
of monsoon rains.
