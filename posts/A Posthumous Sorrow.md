Losing a loved one is like\
Losing a part of yourself, they say.

It's like,\
The excruciating withdrawal from\
An addiction of decades,\
And five stages of grief,\
Fifteen times over,\
Simultaneously,\
They say.

But for you,\
Your very first trauma\
Left a void so dark\
With tendrils wrapped around\
Each of your ventricle of your heart,\
And it can no longer beat beyond\
Barely keeping you alive,\
With no energy left\
For ecstasy or grief\
And so now death...\
Is but a blip.

An immeasurable crest\
On an ECG,\
A detached observation;\
Dispassionate, but uncruel.

But the absence is incessant.\
The absence... will linger.\
Not stubbornly, but matter-of-factly.

And four months from now,\
When you've had too many smiles\
And too few catastrophes,\
that, is when the absence\
Will make you feel it's presence\
And you will break down then,\
At the wrong place\
At the wrong time\
In the wrong context\
And perhaps,\
You'll justify it\
Like I did\
In a poem written\
In third person\
Just as detached from reality\
As you are now.

You grief will begin,\
When everyone else's\
Has ended.

To you, my friend,\
Death will always be\
A posthumous sorrow.
