Untitled.

Such is life. Untitled.\
At 23, what can life be,\
but, untitled.

Then why do I see titles?

Why does,\
everywhere I look,\
it seem like\
everyone is\
holding up bright\
neon lights\
flexing that\
they got titles?

Are those real titles?\
Are those strong titles?\
Where did they find the titles?\
How did they find the titles?\
Why couldn't I find the titles?\
Why can't I find the titles?

Where was I when\
they were all finding titles?

Where was I when\
they were all learning\
how to find titles?

Why are\
disparate words\
all I can find?

Why must words be impossible\
to arrange into titles?

Why must words be blades\
that may or may not\
hurt the other\
but always cut into\
the fist that wields them?

Why can't I\
collect that blood\
and fill up a quill\
and write a title\
for me quick enough\
'fore the blood dries up?

How many murders\
must I attempt\
to make me bleed\
enough to finish\
writing the title\
before the ink\
dries up again?

Why must I be\
unable to let go\
of needing the title?

Why can't I envy\
untitled corpses?
