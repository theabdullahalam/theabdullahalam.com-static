Why is it that\
feelings only\
feel real\
when directed to someone?

Why does music\
make you yearn\
for having\
a lover to yearn?

Why can't love,\
like clouds,\
just exist?

Wish we could love\
and lust\
and ache\
and envy\
as aimlessly\
as an evening walk.

Wish we could go\
for a walk in the sky.
