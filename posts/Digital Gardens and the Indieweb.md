A digital garden is a public space on the web - a collection of ideas
and thoughts and things it's maintainer thought worth showcasing or
saving. The term "garden" comes from the idea that lately, [platforms on
the internet have become
"streams"](https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/)
of content that flow ceaselessly. Something published today becomes
outdated tomorrow. Old things are archived. Algorithms reward
consistency over quality - as long you keep churning things out, you
will have an audience, regardless of how good those things are.

A digital garden is like a soft retort to all of that giddying
one-upmanship. Over here, everything is static. (Incidentally, static
site generators like 11ty and Jekyll are quite commonly used to build
digital gardens). Publish dates are irrelevant. Some things take seed as
an idea and die away. Some ideas germinate and grow over time. Ideas and
notes link to each other. Revisits and revisions are expected. There is
no niche; specialisation is how machines work, not humans. Anything and
everything I find interesting enough to be seen and shared publicly,
will make it's way here. Anything I create that I think might be fun to
share publicly, will make it's way here. Even the bad stuff.
