I wonder sometimes,\
am I in somebody's journal?

The most random people\
doing the most random things\
on the most random days\
often find their way\
onto pages in my shelf\
or ones and zeroes\
in my laptop.

I wonder if I live\
rent-free\
in someone else's\
as well.

Some people\
make me feel so strongly,\
I wonder,\
how is it possible\
for them to be\
completely\
oblivious about it\
at that moment?

They journey from existing\
ephemerally in reality\
to solid in my thoughts\
and then finally\
into ink and binary,\
ephemeral again\
unsolicited.

Have I ever travelled\
the same road\
and never knew?

Was I lucky enough\
to be solid for an\
ephemeral moment\
and never knew?
