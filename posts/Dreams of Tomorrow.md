Chasing that\
will-o'-the-wisp\
of that which you've\
always dreamed of,\
it would be foolish\
to make that chase\
the only joy\
in your life.

Where will you go\
when your guiding star\
is directly overhead?

A broken promise\
shatters dreams.

A fulfilled promise\
simply hands them\
over to you\
and then promptly\
rests in peace.

So when your dream\
does finally arrive,\
what new promise\
will you make to yourself\
strong enough to bear\
the weight of today?
