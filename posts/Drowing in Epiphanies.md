Your eyes gape wide in sleepless nights,\
Thoughts all racing in despair.\
Till one fine day, an answer hits you\
That seemed to always have been there!

Eyes then open the next morning,\
With nary a trace of the faintest frown,\
But it is a mere matter of time\
'Fore the cosmos once more brings you down...

And then the cruel hands of fate\
Bring you back down to your knees,\
And it's too late now you realise that,\
You were just drowning in epiphanies.
