Lifetimes are spent\
necks craned back,\
the skies and our eyes\
reflecting each other,\
lost in each other,\
an aether with the longing\
to be among clouds\
dissolved in it\
unrequited.

Lifetimes are spent\
never learning that\
the preamble of longing\
is merely imbibed\
and utterly\
unnecessary.

And with just enough steps,\
and just enough sweat,\
and just enough hours,\
and just enough longings\
accepted and forgotten,\
clouds will meet eyes\
at eye-level.
