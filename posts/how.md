how to fall in love with the inevitable rain\
if it is going to wash your favourite puddle away?

how to welcome that fall with a smile\
which will wither your favourite flowers?

how to look forward to surgery\
when the wound kind of feels nice?

how to look forward to death when you can't remember\
what not existing before birth felt like?

how to face the reality of heartbreak\
when you finally feel what vulnerability feels like?

sure, one may learn not to disturb the surface\
to let the moon reflect, but

how does one not want to collect water\
from the stream for himself,\
to actually see the moon in the first place?

how does one not fall in love with the shards,\
when broken glass is all they've seen glints of light in?

how does one dare breathe out,\
when holding a breath in\
is the only thing that\
overwhelms that knot in their gut?
