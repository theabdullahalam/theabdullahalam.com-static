Oneself feels like\
a blurry sphere\
of swirling colors\
and radiant brilliance\
flying along\
the cloud of life -\
dark and ominous,\
barely visible,

streaking across the galaxy,\
floating between the stars,

sometimes sverving\
into the life\
and out again\
and swinging in\
and out again\
sometimes oscillating\
sometimes orbitting\
mostly yearning\
to be in it\
all of the time.

If only the sphere\
could look back and see,\
that suspended in that\
dark and cold\
and invisible cloud\
the only streaks\
of warm colors which\
make that cloud\
worthwhile at all\
are in fact\
tints of themself,\
inks from themself,\
imprinted forever\
onto the universe.
