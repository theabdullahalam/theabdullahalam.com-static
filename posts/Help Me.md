Can you help me?

Can you help me feel something?

The pain of a broken heart is\
long forgotten and\
the ache of longing\
is what my heart longs for\
so\
can you help me feel something?

Can we be real for once?\
Can you be real and\
not just in my head, for once?

I am done running around\
from oasis to oasis\
spending more and more time\
under the hot sun\
running to the water\
eyes set\
on a shimmer\
on the horizon.

Can you help me feel something, for once?\
Can you stop being a mirage for once?

Once a week,\
every week,\
the sinkhole opens up\
in that desert\
in my head\
and the sand drops away\
beneath my feet\
but I don't.

I don't fall down with the sand,\
I just remain there\
suspended in mid air,\
the sand flowing down\
bringing the oases nearer and nearer\
till they're streams splashing\
just beneath my feet\
but I'm still hopelessly suspended\
desperately trying to reach for the\
water but it keeps flowing away\
as I keep being stuck\
as the moon inches down\
and the stars begin to fall\
and the tempting sinkhole\
swallows it all\
leaving behind a darkness\
that blends\
into the black hole\
but refuses to suck\
me in\
leaving me instead with\
nothing but\
the void,\
the black hole, and\
the event horizons\
of all that once was.

Can you let me see for once?\
Can you stop being me for once?\
Can you help me, for once?
