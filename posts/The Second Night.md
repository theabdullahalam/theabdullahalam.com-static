The sun creeps up and floods\
the valley between walls and beds,\
and the creatures that\
reside within, awake\
with warmth and light.

Creatures, at first docile,\
confined\
in the walls, locked in, afraid\
of the menace of the lands\
Tolerating, meditating, venting,\
Inching insiduosly towards\
The end of the day.

But as the sun begins to drop\
Towards the west once again,\
The creatures begin\
to metamorphise, they\
transform without a full moon, they\
grow claws, they\
grow fangs, they\
grow scales;\
a thirst for blood\
dissolved in drool, dripping\
down onto the ground, hungry\
for a new prey.

Hungry for novelty.

Hunting for change, they\
gather scraps and avoid\
the gaze of the creatures\
around them, for, the creatures\
around them are all one\
of them and thus\
they dance with their\
menacing paws and\
clumsy claws on the\
delicate fringes\
of cannibalism.

But the night has only just begun.

The pull of the sun moving\
across the sky is somehow\
outmatched by\
its pull from\
behind the planet,\
out of sight,\
below the horizon.

As the night glides on\
and the abyss feels closer,\
most of the monsters doze off\
out of fear.

The fortunate few, however,\
feel relieved having\
survived one\
of the two nights that\
occur every night.

The first one, of\
scavenge, survival and selfish monotony.

The second, of\
catharsis, calm, and other-worldly melodies.

Melodies that mellow the most\
menacing of monsters.\
melodies that gift might\
to the meekest of men.

An energy born out of pure perception,\
an entity palpable nonetheless.

The second night, a second wave,\
a secret shared by the fortunate few\
who dared stay up.

In spite of tomorrow.
