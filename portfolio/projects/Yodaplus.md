During my time working at [Yodaplus,](https://yodaplus.com/) I worked on their blockchain tokenisation time as a Senior Full-Stack Engineer. 

The purpose of the product was to take real-world finance assets like investments and bonds, and tokenise them on a blockchain, taking advantage of the trust and security that comes with blockchain. The whole process - application, approval, KYC, etc were all implemented in smart contracts, combining the best of both worlds.

We used React and MUI for the front-end, Django, Celery and Redis for the backend and a fork of Ethereum called Xinfin for the blockchain network.
