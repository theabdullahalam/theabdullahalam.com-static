[My travel blog](https://sentient-pixels.com) was a challenge I gave myself to build a website without using any CSS or JS libraries, but style and make everything functional myself. In the end, I was satisfied with how it turned out, so I deployed it live and post my travel blogs on there.

The website is made with pure HTML and hand-writted CSS. Even the slide-out menu on mobile works with some clever CSS involving focused elements and animations.

The website is built with Django and deployed over Nginx.
